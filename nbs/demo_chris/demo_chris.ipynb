For instance: can we automatically detect container ships following a shipping lane? can we find groups of ships moving together in a convoy, or a fishing fleet working together?\n",

Investigation of the ships following this path reveals that they are primarily large container and tanker vessels, indicating a shipping lane and a good target for testing our shipping lane identification algorithms.\n",

    "In the southwestern corner of the map, we see several ships moving along approximately the same course. After direct examination, we identify that the two ships represented by the blue and yellow markers, the `Gulf Valour` and the `Pole`, travel at the same rate alongside each other throughout our sample day. This is the exact type of feature we want for identification of convoys, making this a good test candidate.\n",

    "Finding groups in large datasets such as this is a great application of clustering analysis. Here, we leveraged `HDBSCAN`, developed by [Campello et al.](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) in 2013. `HDBSCAN` improves upon the widely used density-based clustering algorithm `DBSCAN` by turning it into a hierarchical clustering algorithm, which allows it to discover clusters of varying densities within a dataset. This algorithm has a distinct advantage over more common methods such as k-means clustering, as the analyst does not need to specifiy the number of clusters before. Additionally, it can find clusters with more complex shapes and varying densities."

When this occurs for a large number of ships across differeing hour intervals, we have a strong indication for a shipping lane.\n",

The shipping lane comes out as a strong blue line, thanks to the 18 ships that make up that cluster over the 24 hours of data present for this clustering analysis. We can also see additional patterns becoming more obvious now as well. The red line of 14 separate ships traveling northeast towards the tip of the penninsula, or the light green cluster showing the travel of the ship `Malalo`. The fairly consistent bearing and nearby position allows the clustering algorithm to identify the track taken by this ship even with a 10 hour gap in AIS data for this ship as it travels northwest. Additionally, we now see that the `Gulf Valour` and `Pole` have become a single cluster, getting us closer to our goal of convoy identification."
